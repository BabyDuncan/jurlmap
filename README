Compiling
=========
jurlmap depends on the servlet api (jar not included in download). You can do one of the following:
- automatically resolve the dependency using ivy. If you have ivy configured with your ant 
  setup simply run: ant resolve  
- if you want you can manually copy the servlet jar in the lib/ subdirectory
- or you can reconfigure the compile classpath in build.xml to point to where you have the servlet api jar.
